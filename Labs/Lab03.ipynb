    "It is given a graph $G = (V, E)$ which represents a flow network, and two vertices source ‘s’ and sink ‘t’ in it. Every edge $(u,v)$ has a capacity $c(u,v)$. We want to find the maximum possible flow from s to t with the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flow on an edge doesn’t exceed the given capacity of the edge.\n",
    "2. Incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow for every vertex except s and t.\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired flow $f$ is constructed iteratively starting from a zero-flow vector: at each round of the algorithm $f$ is updated in such a way that the capacity and balance constraints are not violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, at each round, given the current flow vector $f$, we define the **residual network** $G_{f}(V,E_{f})$ to be the network with capacity $c_{f}(u,v)=c(u,v)-f(u,v)$. A search on the residual graph $G_f$ is performed to find an **augmenting path** (i.e., a path on the residual network with positive capacity on every edge of the path). If an augmenting path is found, this means that the current flow $f$ on that path can be increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ford–Fulkerson Algorithm \n",
    "**Inputs**: a graph $G=(V,E)$, a vector of flow capacities $c = (c(u,v))_{(u,v) \\in E}$, a source node s, and a sink node t\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: a flow $f = (f(u,v))_{(u,v) \\in E}$ from s to t of maximum throughput\n",

    "1. $f(u,v)\\leftarrow 0$ for all edges $(u,v)$\n",

    "\n",
    "Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is called a \"method\", instead of \"algorithm\", because it does not specify univocally how to select paths. The path in step 2 can be found, for example, with a breadth-first search (BFS) or a depth-first search in $G_{f}(V,E_{f})$. If you use the former, the algorithm is called Edmonds–Karp."
